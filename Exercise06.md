# What is the Koch curve?

## AI Response

The Koch curve, also known as the Koch snowflake when applied to a triangle, is a famous fractal curve. Here's an explanation of what it is and how it's constructed:

1. Basic concept:
   The Koch curve is a continuous curve that has an infinite length, yet bounds a finite area. It's named after the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch, who first described it in 1904.

2. Construction process:
   The Koch curve is created through an iterative process:

   a) Start with a straight line segment.
   b) Divide the line segment into three equal parts.
   c) Replace the middle third with an equilateral triangle (minus its base).
   d) Repeat steps b and c for each of the resulting line segments.

3. Fractal properties:
   - Self-similarity: Each part of the Koch curve is a scaled-down copy of the whole.
   - Infinite length: As you continue the process infinitely, the curve's length approaches infinity.
   - Finite area: Despite its infinite length, the area bounded by the curve (when applied to a closed shape) is finite.

4. Koch snowflake:
   When you apply the Koch curve process to each side of an equilateral triangle, you get the Koch snowflake.
